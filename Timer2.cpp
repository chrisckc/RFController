  This class uses the Arduino Timer2 hardware to provide a timing function accurate to 0.5us
  (the Arduino micros() function is only accurate to to 4us)

  Using this class will change the behavior of the PWM output when using the analogWrite function on Arduino Pins 3 & 11.  
  (PWM output on pins 9 & 10 is controlled by Timer1)
  It could also interfere with other libraries that make use of Timer2

  Timer 2 interrupts have a higher priority than Timers 0 and 1, which means that it takes precedence over the  millis() timer (Timer0) and Timer1
  To use this class you must implement the Timer2 overflow ISR in the main sketch
  and make it call the increment counter method in this class

  eg:
  ISR(TIMER2_OVF_vect)
  {
    timer2.incrementOverflowCounter(); //increment the timer2 overflow counter
  }
  Note that due to the use of the overflow interrupt, the call to getCount() may be delayed on some occasions.
  If the interrupt occurred just before the call was made, the timer value that is read may be slightly higher
  Testing with a uniform square wave shows that the delay occurs in only around every 100 reads or so.
  The maximum variation in timings was observed to be at the most 4 to 5 us.
  Here is a sample of the worst case of variation, notice the 36,-28 that was captured, which occurs around every 100 samples
  ,-32,32,-33,31,-32,32,-33,31,-32,32,-32,31,-32,32,-33,31,-32,32,-32,36,-28,31,-32,31,-32,31,-33,31,-32,32
  Using the 16bit Timer1 would allow the overflow to be avoided and timer resets used instead to eliminate this issue
  I wanted to leave Timer1 free for other uses and this variation is insignificant for the purpose this class is to be used for
