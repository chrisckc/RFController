General Notes:

Paths to teensy hardware libraries
/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/teensy/avr/libraries
/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/teensy/avr/cores/teensy


To use on different hardware such as teensy, c_cpp_properties.json must be modified
The includePaths and browse.path entries must be modified to suit the hardware.

The defines in the c_cpp_properties.json file are required to make intellisense error detection work properly.
Different hardware will require different entries which can be discovered by searching the avr libraries.

"defines": [
                "UBRRH", // required for Serial class
                "__AVR__", // general Arduino definitions
                "__AVR_ATmega328P__",  // hardware specific
                "__STL_HAS_NAMESPACES",  // required for the AvrSTL library
                "__STL_USE_NEW_IOSTREAMS"  // required for the AvrSTL library
            ],
